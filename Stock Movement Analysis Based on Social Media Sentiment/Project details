Stock Movement Analysis Based on Social Media Sentiment

Objective:
Analyse and predict stock movements by extracting and analysing social media data from Twitter.
The task involves scraping relevant data, performing sentiment analysis, extracting key features, and using them to provide insights into potential stock price trends.

Task Requirements:
1. Data Collection:
● Scrape relevant data from specific handles that discuss stock market trends, predictions, or individual stocks.
Example: Stock-specific Twitter hashtags
● Clean and preprocess the data to ensure quality and consistency (handle missing values, remove noise, etc.)

2. Data Analysis & Feature Extraction:
● Perform sentiment analysis on the scraped data to gauge the overall mood
(positive/negative/neutral) related to specific stocks.
● Extract key features such as:
○ Sentiment polarity (e.g., whether the discussions around a stock are
generally positive or negative).
○ Frequency of mentions for specific stocks or market trends.
○ Topic modeling (Optional): Identify key discussion themes.
● Explore potential correlations between the features (sentiment, mentions) and actual stock price movements over time.



3. Visualization & Reporting:
● Create clear visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs) that show:
○ Trends in stock sentiment or frequency of mentions over time.
○ Correlations between sentiment and stock price movements.
● Report Findings: Provide insights based on the analysis, such as:
○ Which stocks show significant changes in price based on social media
sentiment.
○ Possible buy/sell signals based on social media discussions.
